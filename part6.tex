\index{Money}
\index{Magic}

\paragraph{Riches}
Different types of treasure, from gems to artwork to functional items, have a certain value. Traders often want to haggle this price or, in the case of items worth thousands of Shillings, they may not be able to afford it at all.

\paragraph{Coins}
All coins are valued against the \textbf{Silver-Standard Shilling} (s). One Shilling gets you a decent bed, meal and drink for the night and is the amount a typical labourer earns in a week.

There is a huge variety of coins that are valued against the Shilling, with two being especially common.

\subparagraph{Copper Pennies} (p) are worth a tenth of a Shilling. One Penny buys you a cheap drink in a bad tavern or a passage on a ferry.

\subparagraph{Gold Guilders} (g) are worth one hundred Shillings. One Guilder gets you a good horse, full set of armour, or valuable piece of jewellery.

\paragraph{Creating New Magic Spells}
\index{Spells}
Use \textbf{Chapter 4: Magic} as a reference of power levels and possible effects when creating new Spells.

\index{Spells!damage}
Rough Damage estimate:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cantrips}: d4
	\item \textbf{\nth{1} Circle}: d4 to d6
	\item \textbf{\nth{2} Circle}: d6 to d8
	\item \textbf{\nth{3} Circle}: d8 to d10
	\item \textbf{\nth{4} Circle}: d10 to d12
	\item \textbf{\nth{5} Circle}: d12
\end{itemize}

Continuous and area-of-effect Spells usually deal less Damage than instant ones of the same Circle.

\index{Damage!elemental}
\index{Elemental Damage|see {Damage, elemental}}
Some Spells might deal Elemental Damage. Most common are Cold, Electricity, and Fire.

Appropriate saves against certain effects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{STR:} physical obstacles, touch Spells, metamorphosis and other bodily influences
	\item \textbf{DEX:} evasion, balance, extinguishing the flames
	\item \textbf{WIL:} fear, illusions, and mind control.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Breaking the Rules}
Not all magic functions as that of Mystics. Magic can do anything and is not subject to limitations.

\paragraph{Magic Weapons and Armour}
\index{Magic Weapons|see {Magic, items}}
\index{Weapons}
\index{Magic Armour|see {Magic, items}}
\index{Armour}
\index{Runic}
Weapons created with magical power often have Runic symbols engraved on them, telling their name, history, and purpose. As well as having a \textbf{Raised Damage die} (up to d10) and \textbf{ignoring supernatural resistances}, magical weapons will have an \textbf{extra feature}, such as bursting into flames when it draws blood or guiding the wielder towards gold. This will never be a matter of simply \mbox{doing} more Damage, though some weapons may cause \mbox{\textbf{additional effects}} when they cause Critical Damage, such as turning the victim to stone.

Similarly, magic armour and shields will have an \textbf{extra feature} or offer \textbf{greater protection} against a specific source of Damage.

\vfill

\paragraph{Magic Items}
\index{Magic!items}
Other magic items could include rings, cloaks, gloves, and pendants. These may grant a \textbf{continual effect} on the wearer or require \textbf{activation}. The effect will usually not be exactly the same as a Spell but may be similar.

\vfill

\index{Consumables|see {Magic, items}}
\subparagraph{Consumable Magic Items} such as potions will grant a one-off benefit to the consumer.

\vfill

\index{Magic Rings|see {Magic, items}}
\subparagraph{Magic Rings} are limited to one ring per hand.

\vfill

\index{Wands|see {Magic, items}}
\index{Rods|see {Magic, items}}
\subparagraph{Wands and Rods} have a limited and unknown number of charges. After the first use, roll a d4 and write it down. Every time you use the item, roll a d6. If you roll over this number, decrease it by one. On zero, the item is drained and becomes useless.

\vfill

\paragraph{Drawbacks and Curses}
Most powerful magic items usually have some kind of a drawback or a detriment to its user, either \mbox{permanent} or occurring each time the item is used. Such properties cannot be revealed through \textit{Identify} Spell but only though experimentation and usage.

\section{Example Magic Items}

\paragraph{Amulet of Health Protection}
When found, this ruby amulet has Power of 2d6+6.

Any Damage to STR~Score is subtracted from the amulet's Power instead, then roll a d20: if the roll exceeds amulet's power, it cannot be used again today. Once Power reaches 0, the amulet shatters to pieces.
