\index{Class-ic Edition|see {Classes}}

Instead of using Features and Backgrounds, you could use three original ``Into the Dungeon'' classes.

\begin{comment}
Every character chooses a Class from the following:

\textbf{Warrior}: An adept of martial training.

\textbf{Mystic}: A student of runic magic.

\textbf{Disciple}: A devoted follower of a set of teachings.
\end{comment}

\class{Warrior}
{\em Warriors are at their best in a combat situation. They hit the hardest, can take the most punishment, and control the battlefield with combat techniques.}

\paragraph{Defensive Training}
When rolling for the Hit Points (including your starting roll), roll twice and take the better result.

\paragraph{Offensive Training}
Gain bonus weapon Damage die.

\paragraph{Manoeuvres}
When performing an attack, you may add a Manoeuvre to it (push, trip, disarm, grapple for their next turn, etc.) The attack is carried out as usual, and the opponent must make a Save to avoid an additional effect described by you.

\paragraph{Advancement}
At Proven Level, gain a Follower with a Simple Weapon and Shield each time you visit a friendly settlement. At Expert, this is increased to d4, and at Veteran --- to d6. Your Followers all count as Novice Warriors, but cannot gain further Experience Levels. At Expert, you gain an Apprentice.

\vfill

\class{Mystic}
{\em Mystics study the science of magic. They decode the arcane Runes that give instructions of the precise methods of casting spells.}

\paragraph{Runic}
You can read and speak Runic. The language is particularly found on ancient scrolls, spell tomes, and magical artefacts.

\paragraph{Spellcasting}
You have a Mystic's Focus and Tome containing instructions for two Cantrips and six \nth{1} Circle Spells. Choose a Signature Spell (see Chapter~4: Magic).

\paragraph{Advancement}
Add a new Cantrip and three Spells (of a Circle equal or lower to your Experience Level) to your Tome. From Expert onwards, take on an Apprentice. Choose a new Signature Spell.

\break

\index{Disciple}
\class{Disciple}
{\em Disciples follow a particular Creed which guides their way of life. In return, they can perform daily Rituals and carry a Symbol that becomes imbued with power.}

\paragraph{Creed}
Choose a Creed to follow. This determines what Rituals you can perform, your Symbol, and the laws you must live by.

If you break any of your Creed laws, you must atone by actively enforcing each law of your Creed. Any benefits from Rituals or Symbols are immediately lost until the atonement is complete.

\paragraph{Symbol}
A Disciple's symbol bestows certain powers as long as they remain blessed.

\paragraph{Rituals}
Each Ritual you know can be activated once each day as an action.

\paragraph{Advancement}
Gain the advancement Creed benefit. At Expert Level, gain d4 Followers with Simple Weapons each time you visit a friendly settlement; you may now take on an Apprentice in your Creed.

\subsection{Followers and Apprentices}
Followers have average Ability Scores and 3hp, do not have a Class nor advance in Experience Levels.

You can have up to WIL~/~2 (rounded down)\\Followers at a time. You do not need to take all of your Followers on every Adventure, but you are responsible for their food, shelter, equipment, etc.

You can only have one Apprentice at a time, created as a new character of your class.
