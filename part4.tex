\index{Spells}
\index{Tome}
Written in Runic and found in Tomes and Scrolls. Spells require a few minutes of uninterrupted calm and attention to cast, as well as requiring a set of detailed gestures and incantations. Consequently, Spells are generally impossible to cast in combat.

Mystics can cast any Spell of a Circle \textbf{equal or lower} to their Mystic Level.

\index{Spells!ongoing effects}
\subparagraph{Ongoing effects} last until you cast another Spell, though summoned extraplanar beings remain.

\index{Spells!persistent}
\index{Persistent Spells|see {Spells, persistent}}
\subparagraph{Persistent Spells} have their effects last as long as you wish or until you cast the same Spell again. You can sustain up to \textbf{2~$\times$~Mystic Level} simultaneously.

\vfill
\index{Spells!cantrips}
\index{Cantrips|see {Spells, cantrips}}
\paragraph{Cantrips}
These minor tricks are not true Spells, do not interrupt ongoing effects of the previous Spell, and require you to use your Focus to cast them.

\vfill
\index{Focus}
\paragraph{Focus}
Every Mystic carries a Focus, typically an orb, wand, or staff that allows to instantly cast a Prepared Spell or any Cantrip you know as an action, while performing the proper gestures and incantations.

A Focus does not work when wearing armour.

\index{Spells!dispel}
\index{Dispel|see {Spells, dispel}}
\paragraph{Dispel}
The Focus can be used to \textbf{dispel} the ongoing effect of another Mystic's Spell unless they pass a \save{WIL}. If their Mystic Level is higher than yours, they get an Advantage.

Dispelling a Persistent Spell requires \textbf{you} to make a \save{WIL} instead. On fail the Spell stays, and you suffer WIL~Loss based on the Spell Circle: from d2 (Cantrip) to d12 (\nth{5} Circle). If your Mystic Level is higher than the Spell Circle, you have an Advantage.

\vfill
\begin{dbox}
	Scrolls of new Spells found by Mystics are usually attached to the Tome for the convenience of usage.

	See \textbf{\safenameref{sec:manufacture_of_magic_equipment}{Manufacture of Magic Equipment}} in \mbox{\textbf{\customref{ch:appendix_a}{Appendix A}}} for the additional information on creation of Focuses and Scrolls.
\end{dbox}

\vfill
\index{Scroll Activation}
\begin{dbox}
	\paragraph{Scroll Activation (optional)}
	Any character can activate a Scroll as an action. The Spell is cast as Signature, destroying the Scroll. Succeed on a \save{WIL} or suffer a \textbf{Magic Mishap} (see \textbf{\safenameref{sec:magic_mishaps}{Magic Mishaps}} in \textbf{\customref{ch:appendix_a}{Appendix A}}).
\end{dbox}

\break

\index{Spells!prepared}
\index{Prepared Spells|see {Spells, prepared}}
\paragraph{Prepared Spells}
During the Rest you can use your Tome to prepare a number of Spells equal to your Experience Level to cast using your Focus as an action.

Casting a Prepared Spell causes Damage equal to its Spell Circle~$\times$~2 \textbf{to the caster} ignoring Armour. At 0hp, this Damage targets WIL instead of STR: pass a \save{WIL} or fall unconscious for a few minutes.
\begin{dbox}
	Optionally, this will result in a \textbf{Magic Mishap} as well (see \textbf{\safenameref{sec:magic_mishaps}{Magic Mishaps}} in \textbf{\customref{ch:appendix_a}{Appendix A}}).
\end{dbox}

\vfill
\index{Spells!signature}
\index{Signature Spells|see {Spells, signature}}
\paragraph{Signature Spells}
Each time you take Mystic Feature, choose a new Signature Spell to cast without preparation and at half its cost (1hp per Spell Circle).
