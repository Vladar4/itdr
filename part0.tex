\chapterx{Introduction}

\section*{The World}

The world is too large for anyone to map and too old for scriptures to fully record. Cities grow from the ruins of fallen civilizations before them and new technology thrives alongside ancient devices. \mbox{Adventurers} return from every direction with tales of bizarre places, both wondrous and horrific.

You are an Adventurer, braving the unknown in search of riches, fame, knowledge, or power.

\section*{The Gods}
\index{Gods|see {Religion}}
\index{Religion}

Tribesmen paint cave walls with their image and each corner of the world has its own folklore. The belligerent men of Baru, the stolen city, worship the four brothers, while the pale pilgrims seek the return of their lost father from the deep void. Some claim that they gifted us with knowledge and magic, others are claiming that Mystics anger the gods with their dark studies.

\section*{Monsters}
\index{Monsters}

Sage Baizin spent her short life compiling a bestiary of the known fauna but knew that searching in places too dark, deep, or distant would show her things too foul to be recorded on page. Fools that seek out monsters to slay usually find their own death before too long.

\section*{Runes and Magic}
\index{Runic}
\index{Magic}

Those that can decode arcane Runes have access to lost knowledge of the history of men and secret rites that release spells of great power. Mystics believe that this power was left by dead gods and study their tomes jealously, seeking scrolls to further their knowledge and increase their power. A single, intricate Rune can contain as much information as a whole page of common script.

\section*{Surviving the World}

Adventurers may have impressive skills or access to magic of great power, but no one survives getting their throat cut or falling down a hundred-foot pit. Run, sneak, surrender, or bribe. Whatever it takes to get what you need and escape with your life is just as good as fighting.

\section*{Going Beyond Expeditions}

There is a long list of brave, dead adventurers. The few live long enough to go onto much greater things as generals, cult leaders, or emperors. There are even stories of those that have uncovered the true power of the Gods and ascended to Godhood themselves.

\section*{New to RPGs?}

\subsection*{How do you play?}
One player is the Referee, who describes the situation the other players' characters are currently in. The players may then ask questions and have their character interact with the environment. The Referee will tell the players what happens or if they need to roll dice to determine the outcomes of their actions.

\subsection*{What do you need?}
A set of polyhedral dice, pencils and paper. The Referee prepares a location for the characters to explore or may use an existing adventure module.
