Size Score, or SIZ, is a measure of the populace of your Domain and may reach a maximum of 20.

Each month, you must choose a focus for your \mbox{Domain} from the following:

\subparagraph{Taxation:} You gather extra money this month, gaining 1s for each of your populace.

\subparagraph{Growth:} Roll d20. If this is higher than your SIZ, then your SIZ is increased by 1.

\subparagraph{Prosperity:} You do not need to roll to see if there is Unrest in your Domain this month.

\paragraph{Civil Unrest}
At the end of the month, roll d20. If this is equal or lower than your SIZ, there is Unrest in your Domain. 10\% of your population revolts and must be quashed or else they seize control of your Domain.

\index{Soldiers}
\subparagraph{Training Soldiers:} 20\% of populace are fit for calling into service as poorly skilled conscripts (3hp). A further 1\% of your population are professional soldiers (STR~12, 5hp, Novice Warrior). All troops must be equipped as required.

You will have a Disadvantage on your Growth roll next month after such conscription.

An army that won a battle against an equal or stronger opponent can be trained further at the rate of 1\% of your population per month.

Conscripts become soldiers (1s/person), and \mbox{soldiers} become champions (10s/person) (STR~14, 10hp, Proven Warrior).

\subparagraph{Large Battles:} When handling large numbers of combatants (usually 10 or more), they should be massed together as a unit. Units have the same Hit Points as a single combatant, but add 1 Damage for as many times to one they outnumber their opponents (or subtract if outnumbered), from --5 to +5. E.g., a unit of 200 cavemen fighting 50 spearmen outnumber them \mbox{4-to-1}, gaining 4 bonus damage.

When units take Critical Damage, their numbers are halved and they must pass a \save{WIL} or break and disband. At STR~0 they are wiped out.

Individual attacks against units are Impaired.%, \mbox{unless} they cause Blast damage.

Unit attacks against individuals are Enhanced, have +5 Damage bonus, and cause Blast Damage.

\index{Sieges}
\index{Walls}
\index{Structures}
\subparagraph{Sieges:} Wooden walls have 6hp, Armour~6, and stone walls have 8hp, Armour~8. Reducing a wall to 0hp allows passage over it. Walls and other defensive structures usually ignore damage from anything but siege engines and such.

\index{Siege Engines}
\subparagraph{Siege Engines:} Cannons and the like cause d12 Blast Damage.
